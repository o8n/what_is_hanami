# v0.3.1 to-be-released

## Added

* `Struct.constructor` that makes dry-struct more aligned with dry-types; now you can have a struct with a custom constructor that will be called _before_ calling the `new` method (v-kolesnikov)
* `Struct.attribute?` and `Struct.attribute_names` for introspecting struct attributes (flash-gordon)
* `Struct#__new__` is a safe-to-use-in-gems alias for `Struct#new` (flash-gordon)

## Changed

* `.new` without arguments doesn't use nil as an input for non-default types anymore (flash-gordon)

# v0.1.1 2016-11-13

## Fixed

* Make `Dry::Struct` act as a constrained type. This fixes the behavior of sum types containing structs (flash-gordon)

[Compare v0.1.0...v0.1.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-struct/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1)

# v0.1.0 2016-09-21

## Added

* `:strict_with_defaults` constructor type (backus)

## Changed

* [BREAKING] `:strict` was renamed to `:permissive` as it ignores missing keys (backus)
* [BREAKING] `:strict` now raises on unexpected keys (backus)
* Structs no longer auto-register themselves in the types container as they implement `Type` interface and we don't have to wrap them in `Type::Definition` (flash-gordon)
